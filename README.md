3. Configure it as official guide suggests: https://github.com/amazingmarvin/marvin-cli/#configuring
4. Download this workflow and install it to Alfred 5.
5. Try call Alfred and enter `madd Example task +today` and then check the Marvin application -- the new task should be created at the Marvin's inbox.
